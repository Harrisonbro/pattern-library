Title: WordPress wp-config.php file
----
Description: This snippet is a fragment of WordPress's wp-config.php file that defines database variables depending on the environment. Specifically, it checks the value of {$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']} to see what the domain name is.

Two options (local and production) are defined here, but the pattern can extend to more environments (eg. staging).
